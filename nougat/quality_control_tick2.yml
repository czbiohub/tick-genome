pipeline:
 # This field specifies which pipeline needs to be run. Only implemented pipelines can be run.
 QCcontrol
# Which tools need to be used, and in which order.
tools:
 [kmergenie, align]
# Prefix to append to all output files
output: tick2_qualitycontrol_v1
# Minimum contig length to be considered. This parameter is used in several steps in order to 
# discard short contigs (default 1000)
minCtgLength: 1000
# Expected genome size. Used by some assemblers, if unsure, give a rough estimate.
genomeSize: 2400000000
# Number of threads to be used in parallel steps.
threads: 32
# In case a tool needs a predefined kmer size (Rule-of-thumb, try 61 first)
kmer: 81
# This field is mandatory when an alignment needs to be executed, e.g, the tools in the evaluation  
# pipeline use the .bam alignments to work.
